MorseTranslator
===============

Android app to send and receive live Morse code.

I wrote this application as a University project. 

It is built from two different pieces of source code - an encoder to convert entered text to Morse code and a decoder
to listen to Morse code and translate it into text.

This app lacks audio filtering, so can stuggle to decode with background noise or interference.

Feel free to use any of the code.
